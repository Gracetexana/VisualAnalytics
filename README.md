# Visual Analytics

## Taught by Dr. Yusuf Bilgic at RIT

I enrolled in this course during my first semester at RIT from January 2023 to May 2023. I learned various visual analysis techniques, including Tableau, which I specifically focused on when we were given a choice. We also worked extensively with Jupyter Notebooks.
